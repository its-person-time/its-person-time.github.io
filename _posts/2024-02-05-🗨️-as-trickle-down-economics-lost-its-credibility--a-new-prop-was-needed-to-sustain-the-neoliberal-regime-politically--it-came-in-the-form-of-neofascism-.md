> The neofascist assault on democracy is a last-ditch effort on the part of neoliberal capitalism to rescue itself from crisis. The only solution is a decisive retreat from globalized finance.

**Article Thesis:** Neoliberalism has failed the people. In response, corporations have partnered when neo fascists in attempt to use neofacism to retain the status quo. The problem is that neofacism cannot solve inequality, making it unpopular very quickly. This can be its downfall if we work hard to fight neofacism.
