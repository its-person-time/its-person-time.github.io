[Bottled Authors: The Predigital Dream of the Audiobook](https://www.cabinetmagazine.org/kiosk/rubery_matthew_16_march_2021.php) is a delightful 10 minute read on the beauty of imagination. Set in the late 1800s, the primary goal is to survey the audiobook predictions of folks hearing audio recording technology for the first time. The takeaway? It's hard to predict the future. But maybe we can learn something from what our predecessors got right and what they got wrong.

Despite the novelty of the technology, some future improvements were obvious. Portability, for example. Predictions of reading while walking or doing chores abounded. Someone even predicted that we would be able to hear books through "whispering machines" in our hats. One year after Edison began his work on phonographs, a journalist seeing a demo of his work said: "The library of the future will be one which any man can carry under his arm." This proved to be an impressive, far-reaching prediction. Not just because it came so immediately after the first recordings, but because it would take 50 years to successfully record a full-length book.

While portability of audio made sense immediately, other predictions were further off base. Some felt that listening was such a passive activity that audiobooks would feel easier than turning the page of a book. And hopes for multitasking in 1883 proved ambitious[^2] : 

> Everyone while sitting in the cars, walking in the streets, reclining on beds and sofas, could be perpetually listening to Adam Smith‚Äôs moral sentiments, Draper‚Äôs intellectual development, etc., and yet be at the same time talking, resting, working at a carpenter‚Äôs bench, dressing, promenading, practicing finger-exercises on the piano, or other instruments, and so forth.

What both of these predictions did not realize is that attention is finite. In fact, paying attention is the most labor intensive part of consuming a book, whether you're listening or turning pages. Listening and reading feel equally "hard" (if anything, listening is sometimes slower) and multitasking while listening to an audiobook has significant limits.

But even more interesting than the predictions that were wrong were the predictions that weren't there. The article describes a public that took an entertainment source they were used to (books) and mapped it onto the medium of sound.[^1] This suggests that the concept that "medium shapes media" remained illusive to the public. Few, if any, predicted radio shows, auto-tune, or YouTube. 

[^1]: It's entirely possible that this article just didn't cover predictions that didn't involve audiobooks. This article assumes that such predictions weren't widespread. Reach out if you know something I don't.

Reading this article raises the question: **How can we reasonably predict what a brand new medium will do to the media we create with it?** Being able to record video didn't mean plays-on-demand. It meant that the shape of theater changed dramatically. We saw movies, we saw TV shows, we saw America's Funniest Home Videos which then became YouTube. We saw web series and Vines and now TikToks...the nature of the media we create has changed shape millions of times, both as a reaction to the art that came before but also as a reaction to the tools we create, share, and view the art on.

What can we learn from the predictions of the past? It's something I'm pondering over. Let me know what you think.
