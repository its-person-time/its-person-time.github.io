**Inspired by:** [Investing in Greenlight](https://a16z.com/2021/04/28/investing-in-greenlight/)

Greenlight is an app that, amongst other things, allows parents to automatically give kids their allowance if they do a certain number of chores. This leads me to wonder:

❔ How can apps like Greenlight turn a potentially transactional relationship between parents and children into a communal relationship about managing a home together?
- Linking chores to money is understandable, but too close to making things extremely transactional. What does that teach kids about chores and managing a home?
	- That chores should be paid? And maybe that's a good thing? Maybe this is what moves men and women everywhere to grow up understanding that the housespouse _does_ provide a valuable service? Though this is something that will only be used by wealthy people, let's be honest. Poor families and some immigrant families may never use the chores feature. However, wealthy families all over might prefer to use this app for the transferring, Eidi, invest in stocks, etc etc.
	- But at the same time, kids may not benefit developmentally from linking chipping in around the house to making money. Mom and Dad don't get paid for loading the dishwasher.
- Perhaps you could do something more tamagochi-style. Where the house is anthropomorphized a little bit. And as you do chores, the house is healthier and happier. If any one person isn't doing their chores, the house is a little sad.
