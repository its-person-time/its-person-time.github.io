The goal would be to help you discover what _you_ appreciate about art. Not teach you how to appreciate what others have decided are "classics".

- Conversation and explanation is key.
	- Listening to why others appreciate art helps me appreciate art.
	- You could start with simple cards: Dixit or Mysterio or Tarot. Have people sort into categories: "Strong Feelings About", "Ambivalent". Note that it's not about what you "like", it's about what elicits a response from you.
	- Bring in something you could talk about for ages. Why is it something you could talk about forever?
- Reflection on what others say
	- Based on how someone speaks about a work they connected with, what does that say? What patterns do you notice in what they seem to appreciate? Do they appreciate a connection to history? Strong use of color? Art from a particular time or place?
	- Reflect on what others say about you. What sounds consistent? What sounds inconsistent? What makes you think "Huh, I'd never thought about it like that before."
- Reflect on what you say
	- Think over your own explanations on what you like: what patterns, if any, jump out at you?
	- How do you feel about the art others bring in? Which do you appreciate?
- Other questions to consider
	- What are things you _appreciate_ but do not _like_? (I'm reminded of [üó®Ô∏è it's beautiful but I don't like it]({% post_url 2016-08-27-üó®Ô∏è-it-s-beautiful-but-i-don-t-like-it %}))
