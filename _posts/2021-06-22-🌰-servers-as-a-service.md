Blockchain, staking, and PoW enable a powerful new option for data centers and server farms: ghost servers. Just like a ghost kitchen producers food for someone else's label, with blockchain you can hire a motley crew of computers from anywhere to run your code. It's AWS meets ghost kitchen.

The competition is steep, though. AWS is heavily subsidized at the moment: plus centralization is cheaper than decentralization. AWS wins the "ghost server" competitio for now. But. For some use cases, interoperability and getting paid for your interoperability will beat centralization.
