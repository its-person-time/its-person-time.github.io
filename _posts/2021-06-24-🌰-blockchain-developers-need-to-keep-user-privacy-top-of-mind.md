Sometimes blockchain developers forget the risks of public data. Bitcoin is a literal ledger of who has paid money to whom. Addresses are not anonymous, they're pseudonymous. And the [difference is massive](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/05/internet-sleuths-find-joe-bidens-secret-venmo-account-less-10-minutes-causing-potential-national-security-issue/).

If we are not careful, one day our health care premiums, our insurance premiums, and the ads we see will all be based off of the knowledge companies can glean from crawling public blockchains. And how could it be made illegal? It's literally public data.

Yes, privacy coins make money laundering more convenient. But there is a middle balance. We need something that is private _and_ auditable. It's doable, [Tornado.cash](https://app.tornado.cash/compliance/) does it.

**Update:** Cointelegraph recently did [an interview with Jason Potts](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2021/08/23/blockchain-is-as-revolutionary-as-electricty-big-ideas-with-jason-potts), editor of the Journal of Institutional Economics and blockchain enthusiast. Andrew Fenton asked the following: "The Chinese government seems to love blockchain and they don't like things they can't control. So, it seems like it could just turn into Big Brother everywhere."

To which Potts replied:
> Yeah. That's a very illuminating example because where I think we're headed, is that the global blockchain economy splits into two: There's more or less a China version and then the everything else version. In the same way that the internet has already done that.

There is a potential future of split blockchains, that's true. But what Potts is forgetting here is that the issue isn't "China is turning blockchain into a panopticon", the issue is "Blockchains default to keeping data in the open and relying on lightweight psuedonymity, allowing _any_ government to use blockchain for mass surveillance." As outlined above, the architecture of blockchains and the design of blockchain products matter _enormously_ in protecting the future of user privacy and personal freedom.
