Sometimes blockchain developers forget the risks of public data. Bitcoin is a literal ledger of who has paid money to whom. Addresses are not anonymous, they're pseudonymous. And the [difference is massive](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/05/internet-sleuths-find-joe-bidens-secret-venmo-account-less-10-minutes-causing-potential-national-security-issue/).

If we are not careful, one day our health care premiums, our insurance premiums, and the ads we see will all be based off of the knowledge companies can glean from crawling public blockchains. And how could it be made illegal? It's literally public data.

Yes, privacy coins make money laundering more convenient. But there is a middle balance. We need something that is private _and_ auditable. It's doable, [Tornado.cash](https://app.tornado.cash/compliance/) does it.
