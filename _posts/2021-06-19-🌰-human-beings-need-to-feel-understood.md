The way [William Davies and Charles Taylor](https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii128/articles/william-davies-the-politics-of-recognition-in-the-age-of-social-media) talk about the human need to feel recognized...I think they mean humans need to feel understood by others.
- A sense of belonging and acceptance of their true self. 
- Social media creates a format that makes people feel the urge to be recognized, but never actually fulfills that need.
	- By creating a scarcity of attention pyramid, folks never seek to recognize each other, they seek to win the engagement game.
	- Sometimes they seek employment or payment, which leads them to hiding their true self and instead expressing their commoditized self.
	- This leads to a negative feedback loop, in which people chase engagement in order to feel recognized but because engagement is not recognition, because of the scarcity of attention pyramid, that recognition is never fulfilled. People feel bad about themselves and don't feel as though they belong, and continue to seek out recognition by posting more.

**Inspired by:** [The Politics of Recognition in the Age of Social Media](https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii128/articles/william-davies-the-politics-of-recognition-in-the-age-of-social-media)
- my notes on the full essay was: "This article was extremely dense and worth reading again maybe." I had difficulty fully understanding it and getting through it. Would definitely appreciate alternate takes if I missed something.
