title: "\U0001F5E8️ the limitless destructiveness of this economy is because a corporation
  is not a person"
---

> Objecting to Supreme Court rulings that treat corporations as persons, Berry argues that "the limitless destructiveness of this economy comes about precisely because a corporation is not a person." In other words, "It can experience no personal hope or remorse, no change of heart. It cannot humble itself. It goes about its business as if it were immortal, with the single purpose of becoming a bigger pile of money."
