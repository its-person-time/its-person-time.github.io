This question was inspired by [Bottled Authors: The Predigital Dream of the Audiobook](https://www.cabinetmagazine.org/kiosk/rubery_matthew_16_march_2021.php). The article paints a very clear picture of how difficult it is to predict the future. In this case, how the predictions around audiobooks differed from the reality.

It was beautiful to see the predictions of the past: discover what was an obvious step of imagination and what was beyond prediction. For example, the idea that you would listen to audiobooks while walking or biking or doing chores was immediately obvious to our predecessors. Edison began his work recording sounds in 1877. One year later, seeing demos of his work, a journalist said: "The library of the future will be one which any man can carry under his arm." This proved to be an impressive, far-reaching prediction: it would take 50 years to successfully record a full-length book. But the idea that recording audio might result in a completely new style of content was beyond the public's grasp.[^1] The implication from the article's focus on audiobooks is that the public mainly took an entertainment source they were used to (books) and mapped it onto the medium of sound. Few, if any, predicted radio shows, auto-tune, or YouTube. The idea that our creations are shaped by the medium they're created in seems a hard one to grasp.

[^1]: It's entirely possible that this article just didn't cover predictions that didn't involve audiobooks. This article assumes that such predictions weren't widespread. Reach out if you know something I don't.

Correct predictions from the 1800s:
- A few minutes of recorded sound -> audiobooks
- Audiobooks will be used by all, not just by the blind

Interesting misses:
- A quote from 1883[^2]: "Everyone while sitting in the cars, walking in the streets, reclining on beds and sofas, could be perpetually listening to Adam Smith‚Äôs moral sentiments, Draper‚Äôs intellectual development, etc., and yet be at the same time talking, resting, working at a carpenter‚Äôs bench, dressing, promenading, practicing finger-exercises on the piano, or other instruments, and so forth."
	- Listening while doing something else doesn't always mean you pay attention to the same degree as when you read a physical book.
		- What do we know about human attention? What did we know then?
- Reading out loud is slower than reading in your mind. Which means listening to someone else read is slower than reading to yourself.
	- People assumed listening to books would be "less effort" since you don't have to go through the "effort" of reading it. But instead, you're replacing effort for time. It takes longer, and therefore feels like more effort sometimes. Paying attention is also a certain kind of effort.The effort of paying attention outweighs the effort of turning pages or holding up a book, which makes listening and paper-reading feel like the same amount of "work." If anything, sometimes it makes it harder to concentrate on audiobooks unless you have something to occupy yourself physically: washing dishes, sitting in a car or train, etc.
- The type of media we create depends on the medium it is created in.
	- People spoke almost exclusively about audio books when being able to record sound came out. At least in this article. When, in reality, so many other mediums were spawned: radio shows, podcasts, etc. Could they have imagined that books would lead to blog posts and tweets? That movies would lead to vines?

Reading this article really raised the question: **How can we reasonably predict what a brand new medium will do to the media we create with it?** Being able to record video didn't mean everyone got to watch plays all the time. It meant that the shape of theater changed dramatically. We saw movies, we saw TV shows, we saw America's Funniest Home Videos which then became YouTube. We saw web series and Vines and now TikToks...the nature of the media we create has changed shape millions of times, both as a reaction to the art that came before but also as a reaction to the tools we create, share, and view the art on.

Let's use NFTs as a quick example then. NFTs change how we create by allowing creators to attach an economy to a piece of media. Artists can take the route of building access and interoperability into their artwork: you can display this Beeple piece in your living room, and also you can use it at Christie's to gain access to their more discerning auctions. You can display this Solange poster in your dorm, and you can also use it to unlock a private area of her personal website where she posts unreleased samples of upcoming music.

I'm reminded here of [üå± the ability to go public on day 1 is a trap]({% post_url 2021-07-07-üå±-the-ability-to-go-public-on-day-1-is-a-trap %}): with this freedom, there are pitfalls and responsibility. DRMs becomes easy. You thought "[[üå∞ The future is rented]]" before? Now not only do you not own audiobooks, there is no option for you to own audiobooks. It's NFTs all the way down, you are [paying 6 companies $300/mo to access all the media you consume](https://www.webfx.com/blog/internet/the-6-companies-that-own-almost-all-media-infographic/). Additionally, the smell of money may be too strong: each artist becomes indebted to more people. Before, a callous company paid royalties for you to spend a year creating an album your fans loved. Now, all your fans are as excited about the profits they'll make from your crowd-funded album as they are about the music itself. Soon your stadiums are filled with more investors than fans.

There's more here. What are your predictions? What are the obvious impacts of NFT on the way we create media? What are the less obvious impacts?
