From [The Real Problem with Twitter](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2022/05/03/the-real-problem-with-twitter/):
> Twitter is far from a gathering place for representative democratic debate. Its most active users are much more likely to be on the political extremes. They’re also whiter and richer than the average American, not to mention that they have the time to spend all day tweeting, which is quite a rarified luxury.

> “Twitter’s increasingly heated wrangling is not just far from a considered democratic debate,” I write, “but has truly become a spectacle driven by a narrow and unrepresentative group of elites.”

From the [accompanying New Yorker opinion piece](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/our-misguided-obsession-with-twitter):
> Twitter should be treated as the spectacle that it appears to be: something that entertains a small and privileged subset of our population, not a de facto town square where the value of institutions and individuals is adjudicated.
