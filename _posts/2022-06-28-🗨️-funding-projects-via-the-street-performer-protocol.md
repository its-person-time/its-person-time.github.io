From [1000 True Fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/):
> In 1999 John Kelsey and Bruce Schneier published a model for this in First Monday, an online journal. They called it the [Street Performer Protocol](http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue4_6/kelsey/).

> Using the logic of a street performer, the author goes directly to the readers before the book is published; perhaps even before the book is written. The author bypasses the publisher and makes a public statement on the order of: “When I get $100,000 in donations, I will release the next novel in this series.”
> 
> Readers can go to the author’s Web site, see how much money has already been donated, and donate money to the cause of getting his novel out. Note that the author doesn’t care who pays to get the next chapter out; nor does he care how many people read the book that didn’t pay for it. He just cares that his $100,000 pot gets filled. When it does, he publishes the next book. In this case “publish” simply means “make available,” not “bind and distribute through bookstores.” The book is made available, free of charge, to everyone: those who paid for it and those who did not.

> In 2004 author [Lawrence Watt-Evans](http://www.ethshar.com/thesprigganexperiment0.html) used this model to publish his newest novel. He asked his True Fans to collectively pay $100 per month. When he got $100 he posted the next chapter of the novel. The entire book was published online for his True Fans, and then later in paper for all his fans. He is now writing a second novel this way. He gets by on an estimated 200 True Fans because he also publishes in the traditional manner — with advances from a publisher supported by thousands of Lesser Fans.

What's notable here is that any payment can be asked for in exchange for content. Feedback on old content, for example.
