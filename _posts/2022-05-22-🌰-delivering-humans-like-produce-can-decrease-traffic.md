title: "\U0001F330 delivering humans like produce can decrease traffic"
---

Produce is delivered in stages: big trucks to distribution centers (stores), small cars home. Public transit tries to do the same with humans. Smaller buses get you to larger buses or trains. Perhaps autonomous vehicles can follow this approach as well. Instead of your car driving you all the way to city center, coming back home to take your kids to school, then coming back to your office to pick you up: you use the car only for last-mile delivery. Your car takes you to a hub near a freeway where you walk into an autonomous bus, which then takes you to city center. Fewer cars on the road that way.
