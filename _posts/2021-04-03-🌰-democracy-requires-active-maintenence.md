It rings so true to me that democracy must be communally built, fiercely protected, and lovingly repaired. All of that demands constant work from its occupants.

We do that work by:
- educating ourselves and our children
- fighting for everyone's right to vote
- protecting our government from our politicians
- learning to love and empathize with our fellow occupants

(Occupants was such a hard word to find for this: [[🌰 What do you call a person who resides inside a society or nation？Citizen or resident doesn't always apply to the whole group that matters.]])

**Related to:** [[🌰 demands of democracy]], [[🗨️ The assumption that things can get better, with the expectation that they should, creates the kind of social ferment that yields progress.]]

**Inspiration:**
"It demands of ordinary men and women a degree of skill with complexity and a degree of forbearance with human affairs." - [The Radical Liberal](whiterosemagazine.com/the-radical-liberal)
- I found the article as a whole....a little dense with unclear motivation. The author's goal seemed to be to inspire love and appreciation for liberalism. It loosely works, I agree with some of what the author said, but I wasn't drawn in. It was a little hard to read and he didn't really go into much evidence for his claims. So it made it a little hard to love, imo. There were some good quotes, though.
