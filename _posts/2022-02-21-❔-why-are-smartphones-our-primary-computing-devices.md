title: ❔ Why are smartphones our primary computing devices
---

In a [piece in early Feb 2022](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/augmented-reality-ar/), Nicholas Grous from ARK Invest posited that:
> Today, smartphones are our primary computing devices, thanks in part to capabilities like multi-touch that are more convenient and interactive than on desktop computers.

As a software developer, it's hard to tell which device habits of mine are shared with the average person. While I spend the majority of my day on a desktop or laptop computer, my primary _personal_ computing device _is_ a smartphone. Due in large part to its portability and laptop-fatigue after a long work day. What intrigues me about this small assertion of Grous' is the idea that multi-touch is smartphones' killer feature. And that it deems them "more interactive" than a desktop computer.

I would posit instead that smartphones' killer feature is its portability. The fact that it is there with me when I need to complete a task is what makes it my primary computing device. Multi-touch, outside of gaming, is a necessary compensation of how small the device is. It's not inherently more convenient than a keyboard and mouse once the screen becomes larger.

What is your primary computing device and why?
