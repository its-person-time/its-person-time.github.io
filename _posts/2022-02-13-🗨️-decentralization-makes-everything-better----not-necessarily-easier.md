title: "\U0001F5E8️ decentralization makes everything better -- not necessarily easier"

> From a sociopolitical perspective, decentralization helps distribute and democratize power and empowers the active participants of any given society (or organization), rather than those who are more privileged.
> 
> From an economic point of view, decentralization helps remove the costs, inefficiencies and risks associated with needing to trust intermediaries and centralized parties.
> 
> Simply put, it just makes everything better --- **not necessarily easier, but better**.

Emphasis mine here. I'm reminded of Linux. The flexibility and ownership of Linux is powerful and to some, "better" than the limitations and data-grabbing of other OSes. But at the same time, rule by committee is slow, cumbersome, and fractured. You'll never convince everyone to adopt new standards right away, and many will prioritize convenience over ownership. Think of the user experience of Linux vs. Apple. And who has more human customers? It's similar to what Moxie touched on in [his take on web3](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html).
