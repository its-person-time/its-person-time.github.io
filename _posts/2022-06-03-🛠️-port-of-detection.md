I've had an idea rolling around in my head for a while now. A story on the blockchain, a interactive public art piece, an NFT project that enables on-chain interaction in an interesting way. The idea is this:

A story, in parts, each chapter represented by an NFT. Each chapter's text is publicly available on the blockchain, but encrypted with an unknown key. NFT holders have the ability to decrypt their chapter for everyone-- provided they burn their NFT first.

You either own access, or you _may_ access. You cannot do both.

## Goals and Non-Goals
It's important with any project to lay out what the goals are and what they _aren't_. Here we go.

I will prioritize:
- building in public
- making a public art piece that improves with user interaction
- creating NFTs that _must_ be interacted with
- putting as much data on-chain as is reasonable
- limiting the scope of the project to 5-20 NFTs max
- making enough money to cover basic project costs

I will not prioritize:
- creating and manage a community space to market this project
- developing add-ons to grow the project beyond its initially designed scope
- making a significant amount of money for myself or NFT holders

Note that just because I'm not prioritizing something doesn't mean it's banned. I'm not forbidden from developing add-ons, you're not forbidden from starting a group chat, etc. That said, nothing about Port of Detection is designed to moon. If the project's concept excites you, welcome! But if you're looking for the next BAYC, this isn't it.

## Roadmap and Status
(If you have any tips or resources for the following tasks, please reach out.)
- [x] get preliminary feedback on the idea from NFT collectors
- [x] publish project announcement
- [ ] publish proposed NFT architecture, get feedback
- [ ] publish proposed website design, get feedback
- üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄ develop rough draft of smart contract
- üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄ develop rough draft of website
- [ ] find Solidity experts willing to give feedback on the contract rough draft, iterate based on feedback
- [ ] finalize the story chapters
- [ ] test finalized contract on testnet
- [ ] deploy website with connection to testnet contract - confirm it can read from the contract as expected
- [ ] recruit volunteers and run a full ecosystem test on the testnet - publish results
- [ ] deploy contract to mainnet and deploy website with connection to mainnet
- [ ] let the fun begin!

## Follow along
There's a lot more to come: details on features and architecture, tutorials on smart contract deployment, and calls for volunteers to help break everything. If you'd like to follow along, you can subscribe to [the blog's RSS feed](/feed.xml) or [this project-specific feed](/feed/by_tag/PortOfDetection.xml).[^1] Or, if RSS isn't your thing, I am [on twitter](https://twitter.com/person72443) and [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/web/@person72443).

[^1]: Why RSS, you ask? Well, it's the most decentralized option and the easiest to set up.
