A conversation between myself and a member of the Origin project. Their OUSD token is designed to accrue interest as you hold it, because the crypto you put in to buy the OUSD is converted to stablecoins that are sent out to yield farm on your behalf. I wanted to know if you could control what strategies your OUSD used.

**me:** I have a question about the ousd yield strategy: is it possible for a person to pick their preferred strategy for their ousd? If, for example, I wanted my ousd put towards market making but didn't want to make any money off of lending, is that an option?
I've been going through the docs on ousd and it sounds like the strategy is made by the vault and it's a blanket strategy for all ousd holders, but I wanted to check

**micah:** No, we want all OUSD to be fungible so that you can send it around and it continues earning no matter who holds it. It would also be really expensive to store unique preferences for every holder.

**me:** Yeah, that's fair. FWIW: lending and interest in particular can be a sticky subject for different religious and cultural groups. Many Muslims and Jews actively avoid earning money via interest for religious reasons. If the development team ever saw a reason to provide a little more customizability in that regard for groups like that, I'd appreciate it. One of the really beautiful things about crypto and DeFi is the ability to earn relatively stable yield from non-lending sources like market making and other rewards. That's just not possible for small fry in the traditional finance world. To have that flexibility with the ease of ousd would be absolutely magical for folks like myself. But I completely understand why it may not be a reasonable addition to the roadmap. Just wanted to share the request anyway in case it becomes possible in the future :) Thanks!

**micah:** We understand, and thanks for offering this perspective.

**me:** Thanks for listening! Have a good one :)
