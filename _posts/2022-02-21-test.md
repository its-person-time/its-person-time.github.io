#  test

This is a test of the new highlighting [obyde](https://github.com/khalednassar/obyde) feature. I am uploading it as a blog post so I can better get assistance in debugging. Please ignore this blog post.

><mark>What are morning pages? Put simply, the morning pages are three pages of longhand writing, strictly stream-of-consciousness==: “Oh, god, another morning. I have NOTHING to say. I need to wash the curtains. Did I get my laundry yesterday? Blah, blah, blah ...” They might also, more ingloriously, be called brain drain,since that is one of their main functions.

>The morning pages are not supposed to sound smart—although sometimes they might. Most times they won’t, and nobody will ever know except you. Nobody is allowed to read your morning pages except you. ==And you shouldn’t even read them yourself for the first eight weeks or so.</mark> Just write three pages, and stick them into an envelope. Or write three pages in a spiral notebook and don’t leaf back through. Just write three pages ... and write three more pages the next day.
