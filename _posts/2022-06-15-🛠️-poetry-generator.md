title: "\U0001F6E0️ poetry generator"
---

As part of my work on [🛠️ Port of Detection]({% post_url 2022-06-03-🛠️-port-of-detection %}), I've started exploring generated text art. This series of interactive artworks allows you to join me.

- [🌰 concrete poetry pathfinder]({% post_url 2022-06-30-🌰-concrete-poetry-pathfinder %}): Inspired by Layli Long Soldier's 
 [_Obligations 2_](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/149976/obligations-2), this artwork allows you to find your own path along a diamond-shaped poem of your choosing.
- [🌰 random poetry generator]({% post_url 2022-06-15-🌰-random-poetry-generator %}): Set your own rules for how poetry should be structured. Experiment with the relationship between parts of speech to generate poetry as long as you'd like.
	- Upcoming features:
		- visualizing the parts of speech
		- allowing you to upload your own set of words
		- improving the default word list

### Updates
**30 Jun 2022:** Previously, this page was the [🌰 random poetry generator]({% post_url 2022-06-15-🌰-random-poetry-generator %}). I've since changed it to a homepage for all my poetry generating projects.
