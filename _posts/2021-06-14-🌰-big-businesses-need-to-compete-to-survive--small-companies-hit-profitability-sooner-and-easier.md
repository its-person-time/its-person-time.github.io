- Big companies are beholden to a variety of bosses-- including investors who, depending on whether the company is private or public, can expect 5-10% annual returns. Small businesses don't have that pressure-- they just need enough money to support a small team.
- A $1M/year of revenue is a huge deal to a team of 3. It's not worth talking about in a VC-funded startup. It's the curse of VC funding.
- I'm reminded of the [tech crunch article](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/23/cookie-startup-fails-to-rise/) about a cookie delivery business that was perfectly profitable (36% gross margins! 12% net profit!) but shut down because they weren't poised to return the 10x, 100x that VC funding demands. Meanwhile, [according to restaurant saas company Restaurant365](https://www.restaurant365.com/blog/what-is-the-average-profit-margin-for-a-restaurant/), the average fast-casual restaurant has 6-9% net profit. Most small restaurant owners would _love_ a 12% net profit.

> Companies need to compete to win. They need to generate more revenue, or get more ownership in a company, to make their economics work than individuals do. Plus, companies typically move too slowly to take advantage of micro-opportunities in the way that individuals can.
