I talk a bit in [ðŸŒ³ predicting the effects of a new medium is hard]({% post_url 2021-08-19-ðŸŒ³-predicting-the-effects-of-a-new-medium-is-hard %}) about how we can better predict the impact of a new medium on the art we create. Let's go through that exercise with NFTs.

I'll use the framework I laid out before:
### 1. Assume it'll get faster, easier, and more robust.
Easy. Assume NFTs are cheap and easy to create. Assume everything discussed in [ðŸŒ± NFT best practices necessitate proving data integrity]({% post_url 2021-06-09-ðŸŒ±-nft-best-practices-necessitate-proving-data-integrity %}) is resolved. We solve file decay problems,  link validation problems, and royalties-don't-work-if-you-sell-them-on-a-different-platform problems. The security gets better...the technology is perfectly and safely usable.
### 2. What aspects of the human condition will have an impact?
1. With content so far it's been the dopamine addiction. Our predecessor may have dreamt of man improving himself by listening to "Adam Smithâ€™s moral sentiments", but little did they know that an hour long episode of two guys talking about _Gilmore Girls_ would be more engaging.
	- The dopamine drip has resulted in more humorous content, content lengthening and shrinking, CGI, etc.
2. There are also things like tribalism, belonging, compassion, and elitism that drive the content we create.

Because of 1, I think we see things like pet rocks, Bored Apes, cats, etc. Presumably eventually we'll move on from that to things that are more engaging. Bitmojis, videos, NFTs that can interact with each other. Jpgs won't sustain us for long.

2 is where it gets interesting. Status and belonging are already in play to a certain extent. The amount of money spent on pictures of rocks is, in part, a status symbol. Belonging can make larger use cases more appealing. As will tribalism, curiosity, and creativity. Humans love to be creative. If there are tools that allow people to build complex, interoperable NFTs easily, the space will explode.

### 3. "What can I create that I couldn't before?" ðŸ”„ "How will this build on itself?"
<mark>In progress: this section can be way tighter</mark>
NFTs change how we create by allowing creators to attach an economy to a piece of media. Artists can take the route of building access and interoperability into their artwork: you can display this Beeple piece in your living room, and also you can use it at Christie's to gain access to their more discerning auctions. You can display this Solange poster in your dorm, and you can also use it to unlock a private area of her personal website where she posts unreleased samples of upcoming music.

If you create tools that allow people to create interoperable NFTs easily (like [async.art](https://async.art)), that will build. Imagine a world where your profile picture changes colors with the weather, or that Solange poster sparkles when a new album is released. The music poster idea is an interesting one because it bridges the online and offline worlds. Imagine your concert ticket was an NFT poster that you purchased. It could change to reflect where you were seated in the concert, your heart rate at the concert, or your favorite song. Restaurants and bars near the concert venue could sign up to offer discounts to concert goers. So now you get your NFT poster scanned at the burrito place a _little_ off the beaten path to the venue so you can get 10% off your dinner.

The thing that NFTs allow that other systems don't is that the APIs are open by default. Which means people _can_ build on top of your NFTs by default. If Ticketmaster decides to make NFT concert tickets on a public blockchain, Spotify can link with that to allow artists to connect with those fans in new ways. Yes, Ticketmaster can make it hard by encrypting all their blockchain data or linking to metadata that needs a password to access. But that may make their tickets less valuable to artists and fans. Especially if a competitor is offering a concert ticket you can share on Instagram, use to unlock special access to the artist, and gives a cut to the artist every time it gets resold.

We can also go in the indie creator direction. Folks could layers of NFTs that others can use might find more prominence. The way memes take off and build on each other. What kind of content would people enjoy owning or interacting with using an NFT? I'm trying to get unexpected here, the way YouTube has recently seen a plethora of videos of people cleaning extremely dirty carpets and cars. What kind of content is uniquely NFT? Perhaps art that reflects a certain kind of data? You could spend hours watching the migration patterns of a shark species if presented in a meditative way. I'm reminded of the work of [Toshiyuki Inoko and TeamLab](https://discovery.cathaypacific.com/the-wizard-of-awes-teamlab-founder-brings-the-magic-to-macao/). Let's say you had art that reflects the migration patterns of a shark species. What could I build with that? I could use it as the background of a website or as a moving profile picture. I could make it my Zoom or Google hangouts background. A store might be able to display it on the wall when I walk in. Heck, if there was a protocol to store your sizes and style preferences in an encrypted way, stores could allow you to unlock that data briefly in their stores so they can direct you to the right products.

### What to build away from
I'm reminded of [ðŸŒ± the ability to go public on day 1 is a trap]({% post_url 2021-07-07-ðŸŒ±-the-ability-to-go-public-on-day-1-is-a-trap %}): with this freedom, there are pitfalls and responsibility. DRMs becomes easy. You thought "[[ðŸŒ° The future is rented]]" before? Now not only do you not own audiobooks, there is no option for you to own audiobooks. It's NFTs all the way down, you are [paying 6 companies $300/mo to access all the media you consume](https://www.webfx.com/blog/internet/the-6-companies-that-own-almost-all-media-infographic/).

Plus, as we've discussed before, [ðŸŒ° money strips an interaction of spiritual value]({% post_url 2021-06-13-ðŸŒ°-money-strips-an-interaction-of-spiritual-value %}), which could change the relationship between musicians and fans for the worse. Before, a callous company paid royalties so you could create an album your fans loved. Now, all your fans are as excited about the profits they'll make from your crowd-funded album as they are about the music itself. Soon your stadiums are filled with more investors than fans.

There's more to discuss here. What are your predictions? **What are the obvious impacts of NFT on the way we create media? What are the less obvious impacts?**
