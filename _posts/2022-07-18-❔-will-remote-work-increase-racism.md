title: ‚ùî will remote work increase racism
---

I wonder how much cultural exchange will change due to remote work.

For starters, I don't know the baseline of cultural exchange in the US. To what extent does your workplace impact your worldview? My suspicion is that for many people, the office and school are where they meet the highest number of people different from them. I wouldn't be surprised if I was the first Muslim some of my coworkers have ever met. I am still looking for any research into this topic, but in the meantime, let's assume that you meet the highest number of people who aren't like you at your job.

What does that mean for remote workers? If more white-collar employees shift remote, how will that impact cultural exchange within a country?

One potential improvement is geographic diversity. An HR specialist in Arkansas could have a coworker in Buenos Aires for the first time in his life (and vice versa). Spending 8 hours a day with people from around the world could provide the influx of cultural exchange we seem to need.

On the flip side, what if it makes racism _worse_? If the Arkansan HR specialist and his Argentinian coworker were both working at the same physical office then, yes, they likely interact for 4-8 hours a day. If the HR specialist is Jewish and fasting for Yom Kippur, all his coworkers will know about it. If the Argentinian coworker grew up during the Dirty War, which has a strong influence on her politics today, it may come up over drinks.

When working remotely, none of this is guaranteed. Happy hours are depressing and short, if they exist at all. There's no longer the casual "Hey, want to grab lunch?" to initiate a conversation about fasting, nor will anyone notice the henna on your hands after your best friend's wedding. Heck, apparently you can [have an entire baby](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/business/work-baby.html) without telling anyone.

Not only is this an exposure issue, it's an emotional attachment issue. How much did you know about your coworker's prior to the pandemic? How much do you know about them now? How has that impacted how much you _care_ about them? Do you feel like they care about you?

My concern is that decreased exposure to "otherness" will lead to a decreased tolerance for other cultures and perspectives. When you're not seeing kimchi in the cafeteria or dreadlocks in the board room or overhearing conversations about milking cows, does your world view contract? Will a emotionally & culturally flatter work experience improve or impair cultural relations and acceptance across the US?

Let me know your thoughts.
