Coin Telegraph did a [magazine article](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2021/07/16/defi-can-be-halal-but-not-doge-decentralizing-islamic-finance) recently on halal DeFi. While I appreciated the insights shared in the article, I feel it buries the lead on how groundbreaking crypto and blockchain can be for those Muslims and Jews who avoid making money off of interest.

What does it look like to be a retail investor in the United States that refuses to make money from interest? It's not easy. Bonds are off the table, some folks will even donate the interest they earn on their checking or savings account. Especially as investors approach retirement age, the lack of low-risk, medium-reward options becomes a huge liability for interest-avoiding investors.

That's what makes crypto so game-changing. The ability to do market-making or mining-- the ability to make money off of transaction fees, all of that opens up a plethora of halal low-risk medium-reward shaped[^1] investments to a group of people who've been denied such opportunities in the past.

The TAM here is huge, and designing a crypto checking account that earns you money via staking or liquidity pools etc etc is pretty straightforward compared to what it would take in fiat. Crypto companies have a huge opportunity here.

[^1]: I cannot in good conscience currently describe anything crypto as low-risk. But the _concept_ of making money off of transaction fees is a low-risk investment concept. If you did liquidity mining with a CBDC, that would feel pretty low risk.
