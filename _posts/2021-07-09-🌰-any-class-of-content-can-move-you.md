The funniest quote from [On Taste](https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/on-taste/) is:

> No one doubts that Game of Thrones can entertain its audience, but it cannot move us as King Lear does. The one is an amusement, the other an exploration of human vanity, ignorance, cruelty, and desire.

The essay begins with a story of a Rembrandt piece -- the pinnacle of Light and Shadow until it's revealed to be the work of his student. Suddenly, it's no longer the shining example of beauty it once was. So the essay begins with the admission that elitism can drive our emotional reactions to art.

And now there's the assertion that middle-class media today "cannot move us" as the middle-class media of yesteryear does. Amusing.
