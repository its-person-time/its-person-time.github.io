I've written previously about [the dangers of having a token that is broadly available to the public]({% post_url 2021-07-07-ðŸŒ±-the-ability-to-go-public-on-day-1-is-a-trap %}). I've also written about [how Flow's strategy avoids those dangers]({% post_url 2021-06-23-ðŸŒ±-flow-is-betting-that-the-best-way-to-succeed-as-a-crypto-company-is-to-build-like-they-are-not-a-crypto-company %}). But lately, I've been wondering if that strategy's downsides are worth the benefits.

For those who don't know: [ðŸŒ³ Flow]({% post_url 2021-03-21-ðŸŒ³-flow %}) is a16z-funded Dapper Lab's new blockchain protocol. It's a NFT-first blockchain, with NBA TopShot as their showcase of what other developers can achieve on their platform. The unique thing about Flow is...the FLOW token is unavailable to US investors.

Presumably, this is because of the SEC. For whatever reason, Dapper Labs suspects that Flow will be seen as a security and wants to head that off by not selling FLOW to US customers. But I think it can be a huge advantage. As I write about in "[ðŸŒ± the ability to go public on day 1 is a trap]({% post_url 2021-07-07-ðŸŒ±-the-ability-to-go-public-on-day-1-is-a-trap %})", customers who own your stock care more about money than they do about your product. Which is not what you want in the early days of product development.

That said, this approach also creates a severe disadvantage for Flow in the crypto world. A big partnership like the NBA can be profitable building on Flow. Customers are willing to part with USD to purchase a TopShot. And are willing to resell to other users _only_ on the TopShot platform. But what about everyone else?

Let's say you're a small team who wants to create a custom line of NFTs in the vein of Bored Apes, etc. You want enough custom functionality that Rarible or OpenSea isn't enough for you: you'll need a smart contract custom to your needs. Your options are the following:

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Chain</th>
      <th>Pros</th>
      <th>Cons</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ethereum</td>
		<!-- pros -->
      <td>
		  <ul>
          <li>Everyone has heard of it, many use it.</li>
          <li>At least 3% of your IRL fans probably already have ETH, if not more.</li>
		 <li>Crypto folk who haven't heard of you already might become fans.</li>
        </ul>
	 </td>
		<!-- cons -->
      <td>
		  It's expensive to mint <i>and</i> expensive for your customers to buy due to gas prices. If your usual art price is less than $1000, it may not be worth it.
	 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Solana</td>
      <td>
		  <ul>
          <li>Cheap compared to Ethereum.</li>
		 <li>Up and coming enough that there is a crypto community that might find your work.</li>
        </ul>
	 </td>
      <td>
		  <ul><li>Unlikely many of your customers currently hold any Solana.</li>
			  <li>How much support does Solana have across the ecosystem? Does OpenSea support it? Will your customers feel like second-class citizens in the crypto space?</li></ul>
	 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Flow</td>
      <td>
		  <ul>
          <li>Cheap compared to other options.</li>
          <li>An NFT-first designed platform should make design and building easier.</li>
        </ul>
	 </td>
      <td>
		  <ul>
          <li>Very few crypto nerds use Flow, limiting new fans you can reach.</li>
          <li>FLOW is not easily available for customer to purchase, they will need to create a Blocto app account and then use a credit card to purchase FUSD.</li>
        </ul>
		  Basically, you'll have to convince your IRL fans <i>and</i> new crypto fans to try out the platform in order to give you a chance.

Why, in this case, would you choose Flow? I honestly can't think of a good enough reason. The ability to go viral among the crypto community in the vein of Bored Apes or Zed is pretty much shot due to the fact that no one uses the Flow ecosystem. You'll do a bunch of development work, and eventually have to convince both non-crypto _and_ crypto people that your product is worth paying and receiving FUSD for.

Part of what makes Ethereum valuable is the hype cycle that you, as a small developer, can build on. The value of Ethereum or Solana itself can drive the crypto-public to your product. Flow is like running your average USD business in a world when others are running a business on Apple stock. There are pros and cons, but for the small developer, the difficulty of convincing people to use FUSD to buy products they can't view anywhere other than their Blockto wallet just may not be enough.

This means that for the smallest creators, Flow doesn't make enough sense. And it's possible it'll _never_ make sense. Flow might be the right place for the NBA or MLB or Dr. Seuss to make a cash flow positive fiat business. But it may not provide the big break small creators need to be worth the time and effort.

What do you think? Does this make sense? Is there something I'm missing?
