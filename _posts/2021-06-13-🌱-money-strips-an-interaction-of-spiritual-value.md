**[Assumed Audience](https://maggieappleton.com/assumed-audience):** Intrigued by the impact technology and business have on our relationships and society. May use this piece to give language to or further improve or support your own theories and opinions. Likely enjoys theorizing their agreement or disagreement with this piece.
 
 > **Note:** Here, spiritual means the aspect of the self we perceive as being metaphysical. Things like belonging, happiness, satisfaction, etc which have physical components but don't _feel_ physical in source.

The internet, digital payments, and the gig economy have enabled us to pay for interactions that were otherwise relational. This improves our lives by increasing convenience and reliability. Got a flight at 3am? Uber will definitely be available, even if your friends are not. However, the commodification of favors has a downside: money strips an interaction of spiritual value.

When that Uber driver picks you up, your relationship with that person has not deepened. You agreed to pay them for their service and you have, relationship over. When a friend picks you up from the airport, however, your relationship improves. Giving and asking for favors deepens our relationship with others, increases our compassion, and improves our sense of belonging. The impact a favor has on us is very easily shown by the way customers treat grocery store workers compared to how those same customers would treat their neighbor when asking to borrow sugar.

Again, the convenience is real and valuable. I'm not suggesting that every taxi ride you take negatively impacts your compassion. There is always a time and place to pay for goods and services. The issue comes when people assume that convenience and compensation are the only two values worth optimizing for.

I talk about this in [🌰 tokenization could commoditize every aspect of our relationship with others]({% post_url 2021-06-13-🌰-tokenization-could-commoditize-every-aspect-of-our-relationship-with-others %}). We already see extreme distillations of relationship commodification. Look no further than the [Shoji Morimoto, who gets paid to hang out with people](https://news.yahoo.com/japanese-man-rents-himself-nothing-225531768.html), and [Robert Samuels, who gets paid to wait in line](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/05/a-five-day-wait-for-5000-the-man-who-queues-for-the-uber-rich). And while there is a time and place for both of these services, I see blockchain proponents and thinkers taking this to even more extreme conclusion: paying people minuscule amounts of money for every action that impacts you.

As Dror Poleg puts it in [The Token Society](https://www.drorpoleg.com/the-token-society/):
> Imagine paying a monthly fee to ensure everyone you see says hello to you. Or letting your neighbor earn a fixed amount every time he keeps the volume down and lets you sleep well at night (your sleep tracker will automatically trigger a smart contract that compensates the neighbor each morning; there’s no need to actually speak to him or say thank you). I’ll leave it to your imagination to come up with other possibilities.

> Every act of kindness will become an act of commerce. Is this a nightmare or a dream society?

> I’m not sure.

Paying someone to smile at your cheapens their smiles and decreases the positive impact of their smiles on you. A smile no longer fuels a sense of belonging, it is something you are owed, something you'd paid for. You no longer smile freely at others, after all, you're not getting paid for it.

Micro-payments are a tool. Smart-contracts are a tool. A society is healthiest when it optimizes for human satisfaction, happiness, and health. Wealth can be a proxy for some of these things, but optimizing for wealth and compensation will not achieve all societal goals. Sometimes, what you really need is a friendly face at the baggage claim.
